# DnCNN_Gamma_denoising
In this repository, the main focus is on Denoising the Celeb images using the DnCNN approach. Training of the whole model is done from scratch. 
A corresponding noisy image is generated and fed to the standard DnCNN architecture for every clean image.

We can see a considerable increase in PSNR value after denoising. The model is trained on 20k celeb images. Gpu used for training is GTX 3090, 
and the total time taken to train the model is approx 2 hours.
